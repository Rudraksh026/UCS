              The University Cultural Society (UCS), founded in 1968, is the
              central cultural body of our university, responsible for planning,
              organising, and managing major events throughout the year. We
              bring students together through meaningful cultural activities
              while ensuring that every event runs smoothly, creatively, and
              professionally.
              <br />
              From flagship events like Pant Jayanti, the bi-annual Kisan Mela,
              and the Alumni Meet, to various events, UCS takes the lead in
              coordinating performances, managing logistics, and engaging
              participants from across the university.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              With every event we conduct, our goal is to offer students
              opportunities to participate, perform, volunteer, and grow—both
              personally and artistically. 
              <br />At UCS, we don’t just organise
              events— we build experiences, encourage teamwork, and create
              moments that unite our university.
